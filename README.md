# Multigit

Implementation of Git in multiple languages

- branch `cgit` is mainline Git in C (from the github.com/git/git mirror)
- branch `gogit` is a literal revision-for-revision translation into Go

The master branch contains submodule merges from each language branch,
in a directory that matches the branch name.
